# NeuroDrive-self-driving-car

## Introduction

This project is a self-driving car simulation using a neural network. The neural network is trained using a behavioural cloning. The car is able to drive itself around a track using the trained neural network.


## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the simulation using `python drive.py model.h5`

## Modules
1. [Detect Lanes](01_Detecting_lane_lines): First step of self-driving is to find the lanes. This module uses OpenCV to detect the lanes.
